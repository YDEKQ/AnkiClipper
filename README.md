AnkiClipper
===========

Sends text/HTML clipboard contents to Anki (the flashcard program). It lets you title your clipboard card and add tags. It is also cross-platform for Windows and Mac (using MonoMac).

## Setup
You will need [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) installed and the [Run External Commands](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/683760297) plugin installed.

## Tip
* Use Shortcut program to launch AnkiClipper. I recommend [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) for Windows or [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) for Mac
